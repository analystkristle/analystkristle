Hi! Welcome to my profile. I'm glad that you're here. Let me introduce myself.

My name is Kristle (Kris-**tle**, rhymes with gen-**tle**). I'm a Communication Research graduate who has spent several years navigating the world of Market Research. From that experience, I've developed an instinct for patterns and insights. But over time, I realized I wanted to immerse myself in data analytics and understand data on a much deeper level. That's why I am working on expanding my skillset to be able to move into a data analytics career.

This is where you'll see my journey of continuous learning and the projects that come out of it.

Thank you for visiting, and have a nice day!
